#### Benny Carter - "Easy Money"

My father, Richie T, has an old real-to-real music player. When I was growing up I used to think it was ancient and funny that my dad would play music on it. My grandfather, Rene T, played the organ at church and there are many reels to document this.  However, Richie T. would often record music from the radio as well. There was one snippet of jazz about one minute in length that my dad loved, but could never identify. It was not until Shazam became popular that my dad finally found out the snippet was Benny Carter's "Easy Money".  It is an excellent song and I hope you like it!

#### Solve the Problem

Now let's look at an ultimate classic and maybe one of the first functions I attempted to solve when I first learned JavaScript: "Reverse a String".

##### Built in Methods

Fortunately, JavaScript has built in methods to accomplish this task. 

```js
// using JS built in methods
const reverseStr = (str) => {
	return str
		.split('')
		.reverse()
		.join('');
}
```
First, a function is created using arrow syntax that accepts a string as an argument. Since an empty string is passed into the method as an 
argument, the split method separates our original string by each indexed character and puts it into an array.  The reverse method, and this is a shocker here,  
reverses the order of the array and the join method assembles each index of the array back into a string. 

Another variation would be to use the spread operator to split the string at each index.

```js
// using built in methods and Spread Operator
const reverseStr = (str) => {
	return [...str].reverse().join('');
}
```

Very simple, but alas, when learning fundamentals of programming it is always better to learn from scratch.  
You do not get a badge in Scout's for building a fire with a lighter.
So let's get out a piece of flint and find some sticks and leaves to solve this problem from the ground up. 

##### Iterators

To solve problems where something has to happen to each item in an array or string, my first thought is always to use a loop.  

But first, create a new empty string to hold our new reversed string. Next, start a loop where you will take each character in the original 
string and add it to the beginning of the new empty string. Once the loop completes, the original string should be reversed and you just have to 
return the new reversed string.

```js 
// using a for of loop
const reverseStr = (str) => {
  // create a new empty string to hold the reversed string that we will return
	let reversedStr = '';

	for (let character of str) {
    // reassign reversedStr to add the current indexed character to the beginning of the string
		reversedStr = character + reversedStr;
	}
	return reversedStr;
}
```

Another flavor of the same concept is to use a for loop that starts at the end of the original string, grabs the last character, adds it
to the new empty string, and then moves through the original string backwards. 

```js
const reverseStr = (str) => {
	let reversedStr = '';
  
	for (i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
		reversedStr += str[i];
	}
	return reversedStr;
}
```

Is it possible to use higher order functions? Of course! The map function could be implemented similiar to the for of loop, but let's try to use a reducer function. 
According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce), "The reduce() method executes 
the callback once for each assigned value present." Our callback function should then add each character to the beginning of our accumulator. But
first we must use the split method to get an array like we did in our first attempt. 

```js
// using Reduce method
const reverseStr = (str) => {
	return str
		.split('')
		.reduce((reversedStr, character) => character + reversedStr);
}
```

There are many possible solutions to reverse a string using JavaScript. Above we walked through five different flavors. Feel free to comment
below if you have a different unique method. Take care!
