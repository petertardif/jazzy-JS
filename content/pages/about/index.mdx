Opinionated is a word often thrown around in development conversations, whether it references a new technology, framework, library, or even a developer. In programming, most people can agree that there are many ways to accomplish the same task. Evidence, send out a tweet to the Twittersphere stating "The best way to solve ____________ is to..." and just watch the comments roll in. If you need further evidence, do a quick search on Stack Overflow for a common problem. You might feel like you are in an endless scroll, but you are not. There are so many ways to do the same thing. It is therefore up to the developer or development team to decide on the best approach for their purpose. 

Developers have opinions and as a new developer, it is often hard to find answers that you not only understand, but also provide optimal solutions to a problem. This website is designed to help all levels of JavaScript developers see, review, comment, and/or add multiple approaches to a problem in one place.

Why then the name Jazzy JS? Well, two reasons. Jazz music is built around improvisation and development shares this same spirit. The second reason is my father loves jazz music. If you want to know how I felt about jazz growing up, check out [Paul F. Tompkins stand up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKSMbPbuGYE) on jazz. But over the years and many conversations, I have grown to appreciate and enjoy it. My pops and I have also bonded over jazz music and I want to now share this music with the development world.

So, each entry will follow a similar pattern. I will briefly introduce a song or artist with a link to a spotify track, album, or playlist. The music will have a brief connection to a programming concept or problem, sometimes explicit and sometimes not. The remaining story will then showcase multiple methods of solving the problem curated from around the web to solve the problem. 

I hope you enjoy!
